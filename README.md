# Textecutor
Have you ever tried calling your wife, but she has her phone on silent so you can't get ahold of her? This app allows you to send her phone a text message, something like "full volume" and it cranks the ringtone volume all the way to 11. Then you have a better chance of getting through!

Inspired by the app Tasker, my goal is to make a user friendly app that responds to text message commands.

## Current Features
1. Turn up ringer volume when sending the correct command as a text message (SMS).
1. Add authorized users to the list of contacts that are allowed to do this, so you won't be trolled by your friends.

## Ideas to be implemented...
1. Ability to change commands, or add multiple commands
1. Assign actions to commands (turning the ringer volume all the way up is an action)
1. Assign authorized users per command/action
1. New actions such as responding via text with information such as GPS coordinates, etc.
